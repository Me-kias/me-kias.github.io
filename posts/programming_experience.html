                            <h1>My programming-experience</h1>
                            <p>"I’ve taken some online courses and gained a bit of programming experience along the way.
                                Even though I have some knowledge under my belt, I haven’t built any projects yet, which
                                I know is a key part of learning. I’ve dabbled in a few languages, like Python and
                                C++, and I’m starting to get a feel for how different programming tools work
                                together. When I try to work through a project, I find myself understanding the concepts
                                better, even if I haven't implemented them in my own projects just yet.

                                It’s exciting to learn how code can create real-world applications, and I often find
                                myself getting lost in the logic of programming, which I genuinely enjoy. Each step I
                                take helps me feel more confident in my skills, and I can’t wait to tackle a real
                                project soon! I’m eager to translate my understanding into something tangible, and I’m
                                hopeful that with more practice, I’ll be able to build projects that not only reflect
                                what I’ve learned but also showcase my creativity and problem-solving skills. Overall,
                                I’m looking forward to growing in this field and seeing where my programming journey
                                takes me!"</p>
