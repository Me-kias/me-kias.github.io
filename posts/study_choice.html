                        <h2>Prior Education and Study Background</h2>
                        <p>I finished high school in 2018. Since then, I have taken various online tech courses. These
                            courses have helped me build new skills and stay updated in the tech field. I have
                            participated in various study choice activities. These activities include attending open
                            days, trial study days, and online information sessions.</p>
                        <p>In addition, I had valuable conversations with a study choice advisor through the HZ
                            platform, which further solidified my decision to pursue the HBO-ICT program.</p>

                        <p>My motivation to study HBO-ICT stems from my passion for technology and its endless potential
                            for innovation. From a young age, I have been fascinated by how technology shapes the world

                            system design, and information technology, so I can prepare for the ever-evolving demands of
                            the tech industry.</p>
