                                <h3><img src="../img/strength.jpg" alt="Icon 1" class="info-icon">My strengths</h3>
                                <p>One of my biggest strengths is being organized and managing my time well. I like
                                    staying on top of things and making sure I meet deadlines, which helps keep stress
                                    at bay. I also pick up new skills pretty quickly, especially when it comes to
                                    learning new tech or solving problems, which has been really helpful in my studies
                                    and personal projects.</p>
                            </div>

                                    <h3><img src="../img/weakness.jpg" alt="Icon 1" class="info-icon">My weakness</h3>
                                    <p>On the flip side, I do struggle with procrastination sometimes, especially when a
                                        task seems big or overwhelming. I tend to leave things until the last minute,
                                        which can create unnecessary pressure. I also have a habit of overthinking,
                                        which slows me down when I need to make decisions or finish assignments.</p>

                                        </h3>
                                        <p>In terms of opportunities, I’m lucky to have access to some really great
                                            study spaces. Whether it’s at home or at the library, I have places where I
                                            can focus and work without distractions. Plus, with the school library and
                                            other resources coming up this year, I feel like I’m set up to succeed and
                                            make the most out of my time.</p>

                                            </h3>
                                            <p>As for threats, one thing I worry about is balancing my studies with
                                                everything else in my life. It can be tricky to find enough time for
                                                school when there are so many other things going on. But I’m aware of
                                                it, and I’m trying to be more mindful about how I use my time so I can
                                                stay on track.</p>
