                            <h3>Getting Started in ICT</h3>
                            <br>
                            <p>Starting a career in ICT can be quite accessible, especially with the resources
                                available
                                today. While formal education, such as a bachelor's degree in Computer Science,
                                Information
                                Technology, or a related field, can provide a solid foundation, many successful
                                professionals in this sector also come from non-traditional paths. A degree can help
                                you
                                understand the theoretical aspects of technology, develop critical thinking skills,
                                and gain
                                hands-on experience through projects and internships.</p>

                            <p> For those who may not choose the traditional route, exploring online platforms like
                                Udemy,
                                Coursera, or even YouTube offers a wealth of knowledge on various topics, from
                                coding to
                                data analysis. These platforms allow you to learn at your own pace and focus on
                                specific
                                skills that interest you.</p>
